# talk-angular-ai-powered-development

## Goal

This task tells the story how I started to learn about AI.
How I was struggling, first.
How I was fighting it.
And finally, how I started to integrate it in my work as a frontend engineer.

There is a lot to tell about AI, so I need to continuously remember myself to focus on Angular here.
Luckily the Angular team already did a great job on integrating Angular with the AI ecosystem.
There is already a lot on the offical docs page: https://angular.dev/ai.

So why this talk?
I guess I want to add some background to the whole AI story.
I want to round things up for the Angular Community.

Frequently we see posts with bad quality on social media.
AI genererated content can be really annoying.
But we shall not fall into the trap thinking of AI as a threat, only because of people seeking for plublicity using it in a bad way.

This being said, I will start with **building a healthy mindset when it comes to use AI professionally**.
Than, I need to shift to Angular's pre-work on integrating the platform with AI Agents (**Angular comes prepared**).
In this section I will also explain the purpose of instructions and rules.
Which is the foundation of building an agentic team taking on several tasks like coding, testing, requirements-engineering, review.
After that I will going to show the Angular CLI MCP server and its capabilities.
I shall record a video demonstrating how tool calls are made from the Agent to look up bestr practices of Angular.
