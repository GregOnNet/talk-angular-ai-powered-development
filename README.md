# talk-angular-ai-powered-development

## Goal

This task tells the story how I started to learn about AI.
How I was struggling, first.
How I was fighting it.
And finally, how I started to integrate it in my work as a frontend engineer.

There is a lot to tell about AI, so I need to continuously remember myself to focus on Angular here.
Luckily the Angular team already did a great job on integrating Angular with the AI ecosystem.
There is already a lot on the offical docs page: https://angular.dev/ai.

So why this talk?
I guess I want to add some background to the whole AI story.
I want to round things up for the Angular Community.

Frequently we see posts with bad quality on social media.
AI generated content can be really annoying.
But we shall not fall into the trap thinking of AI as a threat, only because of people seeking for publicity using it in a bad way.

This being said, I will start with **building a healthy mindset when it comes to use AI professionally**.
Than, I need to shift to Angular's pre-work on integrating the platform with AI Agents (**Angular comes prepared**).
In this section I will also explain the purpose of instructions and rules.
Which is the foundation of building an agentic team taking on several tasks like coding, testing, requirements-engineering, review.
After that I will going to show the Angular CLI MCP server and its capabilities.
I shall record a video demonstrating how tool calls are made from the Agent to look up bestr practices of Angular.

## Building AI Skills
The following list holds a bunch of topics we can learn as developers to get used to AI.

- Build a healthy AI mindset
- Use an AI Chat
- Use an Agent
- Expand usage of Agents
- Include tools to your Development Workflows
- Build agentic workflows
- Understand how LLMs work
- Measure LLM output allowing evidence-based decisions

## Distillation for Angular
The following list filters topics especially for using AI with Angular.

- Build a healthy AI mindset
- Angular comes prepared
- Get started with Angular CLI MCP
- Build agentic workflows
- 🍨🍒 Measure LLM output allowing evidence-based decisions

## Build a healthy AI mindset

“AI is incapable of this.”
“AI is incapable of that.”
“Look — this is where vibe-coding leads you… straight to hell.”

I’m sure you’ve seen posts like this before — perhaps even today.
From time to time, you might also stumble across something like:

**Do we still need software developers?**
**Will UX experts and designers still have a future?**

Statements like these can trigger frustration, fear, or at least uncertainty.
Why? Because our brains tend to believe something is true the more often we read or hear it.

This was exactly the situation I faced a year ago.
I launched a new business during an unstable market period, and on top of that, AI seemed poised to eliminate the very career I had built my life around.

Bad news can hit like a massive, dark-blue wave — overwhelming and paralyzing.
But here’s the truth: we cannot control what comes from the outside.
If the waves keep crashing over us, we can learn to surf them.

And that’s what I chose to do.
And luckily the Angular team was already choosing AI as an important strategic pillar, too.

From this moment on I started recognising that everyone was talking about less developers or
bad quality, BUT no one was talking about the potential if we developers start to use AI on our own
with the proficiency we already bring to the table when it comes to complex technical challenges.

I started using AI-Chats and soon I started working with my first coding agent and I delegated
small tasks to it.

Guess what, from that moment on I knew that 90% of the messages in social media and even in the press
was incorrect.
And from this day on I learned. AI is yet another skill that will be added to our toolbelt, such as
testing, architecting, clean coding, automating & versioning already is.

### My personal AI roadmap

1. Mindset Shift - AI & Developer = 💪⚡
1. Chat with LLMs
1. Let and Agent Code
1.1 often felt in an endless loop debugging and fixing stuff
1.2 felt lost in fixing recursion bugs AI had solved before
1. Understand how LLMs work (good enough)
1.1 Learned about facilities of Agentic Coding
1.2 learned how to prevent these facilities
1. Expand usage of Agents
1. Include tools to your Development Workflows
1. Build agentic workflows
1. ✨ Measure LLM output allowing evidence-based decisions
