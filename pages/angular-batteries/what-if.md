# What If: Future Possibilities

Evidence-based decisions enable next steps

<div class="mt-6">

- **Proven quality** - Tools can prove how well generated code performs
- **Confidence** - Move to orchestrating multiple agents
- **Scalability** - Build workflows with measurable results
- **Continuous improvement** - Compare reports over time
- **Team adoption** - Share evidence-based best practices

</div>

<div class="mt-10 text-lg opacity-80">

Now you have a tool that can proof how well your generated code performs

</div>

<div class="mt-6 opacity-70">

This enables you to take the next step in agentic coding: orchestrating not one but multiple agents in a workflow
