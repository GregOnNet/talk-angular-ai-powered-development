Personal journey and practical steps

<div class="mt-6">

- **Recognize the waves** - Bad news hits like a dark-blue wave
- **Learn to surf** - We cannot control what comes from outside

- **Work with agents** - Experience the reality firsthand
- **Trust your experience** - You know what works

1. Face uncertainty and fear
2. Choose to adapt
3. Start using AI tools
4. Recognize the potential
5. Build confidence through practice
