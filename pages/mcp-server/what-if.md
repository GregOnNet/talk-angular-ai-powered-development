# What If: Future Capabilities

Exciting possibilities ahead

<div class="mt-6">

- **Migration tools** - Modernize Angular apps with one tool call
- **Schema execution** - Run all migration schematics automatically
- **Latest APIs** - Migrate to latest Angular APIs
- **More tools** - Additional capabilities expected
- **Workflow integration** - Deeper integration with agentic workflows

</div>

<div class="mt-10 text-lg opacity-80">

In the near future we can expect even more tools...

</div>

<div class="mt-6 opacity-70">

Maybe modernizing our Angular App with one tool call, that executes all the migration schematics for us to migrate to the latest Angular-APIs
